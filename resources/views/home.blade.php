                    Keokuk County is a rural community of rich farmland, friendly people and growing businesses. Located in the southeast quadrant of Iowa, Keokuk County was named after a famous Sac Indian Chief. The name means "Watchful Fox" or "He Who Has Been Everywhere". Chief Keokuk advocated peace with the white settlers. In those days, Sac and Fox Indian tribes could be found roaming the area.

                    Keokuk County is 580 square miles with a population of approximately 10,500. In the center of Keokuk County you will find Sigourney, the county seat. Here the county courthouse sits in the middle of the square with its classical revival style architecture featuring a clock tower and cupola. Sigourney is also the home of Keokuk County Health Center, a 25-bed critical access hospital.

                    Two miles east and two miles north of Sigourney you will find the Belva Deer Recreation Area. This 1,669-acre park has picnic shelters, camping areas, cabin rentals, hiking trails, fishing, hunting, boating ramps, horse trails and a swimming beach. Its 260-acre "no wake" lake draws fishermen from many states.
